# Why Would You Need MSK Control?
We may call MoSKito Control a central monitoring station that receives, handles and presents performance data, collected from multiple servers or applications. 
 
Presenting "a bird's eye view" of the monitored applications, it gives a clear picture of the app's health for both Developers and Managers, predicting a possible or upcoming problem.
Through the concept of Main and Detail Screens, MSK Control displays an overview of all configured components and their detailed info.
